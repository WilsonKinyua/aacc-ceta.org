                                        The All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) Theological Institute Programme
                                        started in 2008 at the 9th AACC General Assembly held in Maputo, Mozambique.
                                        Since then it has been a tradition for the AACC to bring together young
                                        theologians from all over the continent and beyond, for a two-week intensive
                                        theological training, with the possibility of interacting with senior church
                                        leaders, church delegates during the assemblies as well as getting special
                                        ecumenical exposure.

                                        ecumenical-related issues affecting Africa and beyond. This aims at
                                        producing present and future ecumenically-oriented leaders for African
                                        churches and the world at large.
