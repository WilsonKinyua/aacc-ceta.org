                                    <p>The environmental issues confronting the world today require immediate
                                        attention and effective action by all stakeholders. The rapidly changing
                                        environmental systems and depleting resources are causing substantial
                                        concern to government and business leaders around the world, yet, the Church
                                        should also be a major actor in finding sustainable solutions. As part of
                                        its ongoing work on environmental justice, the AACC utilizes all the
                                        available opportunities to raise awareness on key environmental issues as
                                        well as mobilize its membership for action. As part of its commemoration of
                                        this year’s (2022) World Environmental Day, the AACC has lined up a number
                                        of activities that will help raise awareness on the role of the Church in
                                        environmental protection. This comes within the context of the Church’s
                                        reorganization of its structures for effective participation at the
                                        Conference of Parties (COP) 27 which will be held in Egypt from 7-18
                                        November 2022.</p>

                                    <p>The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2021) notes that the world
                                        is in a climate emergency, “a code red for humanity” according to the UN
                                        Secretary-General<a >[1]</a>. The UNEP further
                                        indicates that the concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the
                                        atmosphere is wreaking havoc across the world and threatening lives,
                                        economies, health and food. The world is far from securing a global
                                        temperature rise to below 2°C as promised in the Paris Agreement. As an
                                        emerging major player in Climate Change issues, the Church is challenged to
                                        contribute in its own unique way to the efforts of addressing the impact of
                                        Climate Change.</p>

                                        across the world. The AACC will utilize the World Environment Day
                                        commemorations to amplify the voice of the Church on Climate Change and
                                        other related matters. As part of its preparations for participation at the
                                        COP 27, the AACC will run a week-long campaign on all its platforms
                                        including social media and available physical spaces. While environment is
                                        broad, the AACC will focus mainly on Climate Change in its messaging during
                                        this period as direct contribution to its five-year strategic plan that
                                        partly aims at addressing the impact of this crisis.</p>
